 Library Management System â€“ SQL Project
ðŸ§¾ Project Overview
Project Title: Library Management System
Database: library_db

This project demonstrates SQL skills by designing and querying a library management system. It includes setting up the schema for books, members, employees, and transactions, then running SQL queries to manage and analyze library operations.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Design and implement a relational database for a library.

Populate the database with relevant data (books, members, employees, issued status).

Use SQL to manage, retrieve, and analyze library data.

Answer business questions such as most issued books, frequent members, staff involvement, etc.

Table Creation: Created tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status. Each table includes relevant columns and relationships.

Task 19: Stored Procedure Objective: 
Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system. 
Description: Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the

The procedure should function as follows: 
The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter. 
The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes'). 
If the book is available, it should be issued, and the status in the books table 
should be updated to 'no'. 
If the book is not available (status = 'no'), the procedure should return an error 
message indicating that the book is currently not available.
